### 📝 Notes & Suggestions

- **Customize** each section (e.g., about me, blog).
- **Adjust** build commands depending on your setup—skip npm sections if it's pure HTML/CSS.
- Add **screenshots or GIFs** in the “Features” section to visually showcase your site :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}.
- Optionally include **badges** (e.g., build status, license).

Let me know if you'd like help refining any part—I’m happy to adjust for your content or framework!
